# CalendarDialogBuilder
Clean and easy way to create a caledar in an alert dialog (Android)

I created a simple class that implements a CalendarView in a AlertDialog. Easy to use and modify.

You'll have to import:
- the layout file of the dialog
- the CalendarDialogBuilder class

The implementation you can see in the sample code.
